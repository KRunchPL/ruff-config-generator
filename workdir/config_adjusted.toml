# This setting is only applicable when the target Python version is below
# 3.9 and 3.10 respectively, and is most commonly used when working with
# libraries like Pydantic and FastAPI, which rely on the ability to parse
# type annotations at runtime. The use of from __future__ import annotations
# causes Python to treat the type annotations as strings, which typically
# allows for the use of language features that appear in later Python
# versions but are not yet supported by the current version (e.g., str |
# int). However, libraries that rely on runtime type annotations will
# break if the annotations are incompatible with the current Python
# version.
# For example, while the following is valid Python 3.8 code due to the
# presence of from __future__ import annotations, the use of str| int
# prior to Python 3.10 will cause Pydantic to raise a TypeError at
# runtime:

# from __future__ import annotations

# import pydantic

# class Foo(pydantic.BaseModel):
